### Notes:

The figures in the paper show results from computations performed over an
ensemble of all parameter sets that fit the avaiable data. This file contains
only the best fit parameters. The full ensemble of parameters is available at
http://www.lassp.cornell.edu/sethna/GeneDynamics/PC12DataFiles/ (Also, the
best-fit parameter set produces a curve for DN Rap1 that is less "peakish"
than the ensemble average.)

The conversion factors for EGF and NGF concentrations account for their
molecular weights and the density of cells in the culture dish. These
concentrations are saturating, so the exact values are not critical.

Because the Erk data fit to measure only fold changes in activity, there is no
absolute scale for the y-axes. Thus the curves from this file have different
magnitudes than those published.

To reproduce the figures from the paper:  
2a) For EGF stimulation, set the initial concentration of EGF to 100 ng/ml *
100020 (molecule/cell)/(ng/ml) = 10002000.  
For NGF stimulation, set the initial concentration of NGF to 50 ng/ml * 4560
(molecule/cell)/(ng/ml) = 456000  
5a) To simulate LY294002 addition, set kPI3KRas and kPI3K to 0.  
5b) To simulate a dominant negative Rap1, set kRap1ToBRaf to 0.  
To simulate a dominant negative Ras, set kRasToRaf1 and kPI3KRas to 0.  

Almost all the data fit with this model by the authors are from Western blots.
Given the uncertainties in antibody effectiveness and other factors, one can't
a priori derive a conversion between the arbitrary units for a given set of
data and molecules per cell. So the authors used an adjustable "scale factor"
that converts between molecules per cell and Western blot units.

For the EGF stimulation data in figure 2a) the scale factor conversion is
1.414e-05 (U/mg)/(molecule/cell). For the NGF stimulation data in figure 2a)
it is 7.135e-06 (U/mg)/(molecule/cell).
